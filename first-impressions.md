# Greetings
I've been very interested in getting back into writing algorithmic electronic music from scratch. It's what I spent a great deal of time on in undergrad,
using software like [MaxMSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/) and [PureData](https://puredata.info/). Here's a piece from my 'senior project' called [Crystal Growth](https://soundcloud.com/nickgideo/crystal-growth).  

When I started using MaxMSP and PD, I barely knew anything about programming. For instance, Crystal Growth could have easily been constructed using loops, but because I didn't even know what loops *were*, I basically hard-wired everything. 
If you look at the lower right corner of the image below you'll see a daisy-chain of delays. Each delay corresponds to a 
single triggering of a note played by an oscillator (an object that makes sound). Clearly, this was not a scaleable 
way to make music!

After graduating, I stumbled into a job where I needed to learn how to organize things in spreadsheets,
and automate some of the process. Google Apps (docs, sheets, etc) has a neat feature that lets you write 
[scripts](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) using JavaScript, so I started teaching myself 
a *real* programming language (if you can call it that). 
I quickly realized how idiotic I was to not have used loops in my previous programming efforts (among other things)! 

Another huge advancement was the power of being able to *write* instructions. In MaxMSP and PureData, you 'write code' by 
clicking and dragging 'wires' that connect object blocks. This is *INCREDIBLY* tedious for a large program (see above) so I 
hoped that someday I could find a way to write algorithmic electronic music using a text based programming language and not 
with a damn mouse! 

At about the time I started learning JavaScript, I discovered [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/). I was still 
too green to understand its wacky syntax (more on this later) and didn't know enough about basic programming and comp-sci 
fundamentals to really grok how to use it.
Fast forward a few years to today, where I feel ready to start exploring and writing about the journey<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.

# First Impressions

As I said before, my first *real* (and very serious) language was [JavaScript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat). 
Despite its own weirdness, its syntax and semantics feels like *home*, so it's what I compare to when I learn a new language. 
Lisp was hard because it felt like everything was upside down and inside out. 
C++ was full of pointer pitfalls and compilation errors. Every new language one learns has its awkward learning 
moments, so just like the rest, learning SuperCollider has felt like.. *"Wat?"*. 

## Scope and Nope, Functions and Funtime!

Awesome, so I'm looking at this language now and it looks neat. A little *wierd*, but neat. I boot up the audio-server with 
CTRL-B and try to remember how to make a sound. I think I know how it works so lets see. 
The IDE has nice code-execution -- hitting SHIFT-ENTER will execute a line -- so I hit that as I go. 
Lets make an oscillator and try to make a sound.
``` SuperCollider
x = SinOsc.ar
x.play
```
Output:
``` console
-> a SinOsc
ERROR: Message 'play' not understood.
...
```
Oh, crap. *Right!* I forgot that you need to put curley brackets around the synth like so:
``` SuperCollider
x = {SinOsc.ar}
x.play
```
``` console
-> a Function
-> Synth('temp__1' : 1000)
```
Sweet! This creates a sine-wave generator (the part that says `-> Synth('temp__1' : 1000)` in the post window) at the default 440hz. 
Hitting CTRL-. (ie the Control key and a `.`) kills the sound. 
So what's the deal with the curleys that I needed? As you can see above, 
wrapping statements in curleys turns it into a function (as noted in the post window when it printed 
```
-> a Function
``` 
after I evaluated
that line). Since synths don't have a `play` method, but functions do, we need to wrap code up in curleys to make sure we can execute it
as a sound generator. Ok, sure. Thats fine. 

The code above can be cleaned up a bit too, as you can call methods directly on function literals <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>.
``` SuperCollider
y = {SinOsc.ar}.play;
```
Nice. 

### Let's be interesting
Ok, so let's flesh out this sine wave and try to make it more musical. When we write `SineOsc.ar`, we're creating a synth that is 
generating an audio signal (the `ar` bit means 'audio-rate', which generates enough wave-form samples to sound good when played on
our speakers). We can pass in some arguments to change the default settings like so<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup>:
``` SuperCollider
y = {SinOsc.ar(freq:220, phase:0, mul:0.25, add:0)}.play;
```
Cool. Since I'm in the habit of writing functions that handle little bits of computation, I'd like to write a little function that 
randomly selects a frequency multiplyer for our little sine wave. Here's my first attempt (spoiler alert: this is *incorrect* as we'll see 
shortly). After writing this, I hit CTRL-A to highlight everything and evaluate with CTRL-ENTER:
``` SuperCollider
randHarmonic = {
  var primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13];
  primes[ 6.rand ]; // value of last line of a function is returned implicitly
};

y = {SinOsc.ar( 220 * randHarmonic, mul:0.25)}.play;
```
Uh oh.. I got an error:
``` Error
ERROR: Variable 'randHarmonic' not defined.
  in file 'selected text'
  line 4 char 2:

  };
   
-----------------------------------
ERROR: Variable 'randHarmonic' not defined.
  in file 'selected text'
  line 6 char 34:

  y = {SinOsc.ar( 220 * randHarmonic, mul:0.25)}.play; 
                                    
-----------------------------------
-> nil
```
But I defined `randHarmonic` the same way as the function `y`, didn't I? How come it didn't work? Well dear reader, you'd be surprised to find out 
that SuperCollider treats lower-case single-letter variable names like `y` differently than longer names like `randHarmonic`. Awesome ðŸ™ƒ. It all has to do with local and global variables. Lower case letters are reserved as global variables, and therefore when we
assign a function to one of these letters it is visible everywhere. My `randHarmonic` name isn't visible anywhere, in fact (because I didn't use `var`, I think..), so to make
it into a global variable I have to prepend a `~` before the name. 


Also, to make things easier for evaluation, we need to surround all 
of these statements in `()` paren's to tell the interpreter to treat everything as a **single code block**, with individual statements 
separated by `;` semicolons. This is handy because now we can
evaluate the whole block with CTRL-ENTER without having to highlight every line (as long as the cursor is focused anywhere within the
block). So now our code looks like this:
``` SuperCollider
(
  ~randHarmonic = {
    var primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13];
    primes[ 6.rand ]; // value of last line of a function is returned implicitly
  };

  y = {SinOsc.ar( 220 * ~randHarmonic, mul:0.25)}.play;
)
```
Evaluating this block creates a new synth with a frequency that is multiplied by a randomly selected prime number. If you keep 
evaluating it then it will keep creating new syths that are all in harmony with eachother (though they may sound a bit funny!). 


### Vars and Values
This is all well and good but that's kindof odd if you ask me, what with using a `~` before a name. Isn't there a better way? Why yes, 
in fact, there is. If you haven't guessed already, its the `var` keyword! Another great feature of putting code in a block (by 
surrounding it in parens) is that we can declare scoped variables with the `var` keyword outside of functions. If we make that change, 
we're left with:
``` SuperCollider
(
  var randHarmonic = {
    var primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13];
    primes[ 6.rand ]; // value of last line of a function is returned implicitly
  };

  y = {SinOsc.ar( 220 * randHarmonic, mul:0.25)}.play;
)
```

But you may be wondering something. Take a look at what we are passing into the `SinOsc.ar` method for the `freq` value. It's the 
expression: `220 * randHarmonic`. Isn't `randHarmonic` a function? How did that work if we just pass in the name? Well, I don't 
understand all of the details yet, but lets break it down with an example. 

Write this and evaluate it 
``` supercollider
(
  var three = {3};
  three
)
```
and you'll see 
``` console
-> a Function
```
printed to the post window. 


Now try doing some math:
```
(
  var three = {3};
  2 * three
)
```
If we evaluate this, the post window logs:
```
-> a BinaryOpFunction
```
I'm not really sure how this is working (I can't find this explained in the docs yet) but it looks like the expression `2 * three` is 
treated as a *new* function! Ordinarily in SuperCollider, to call a function we must send the `value` message to the function like so:
``` supercollider
(
  var three = {3};
  three.value;
)
```
```console
-> 3
```

And likewise
``` supercollider
(
  var three = {3};
  (2 * three).value;
)
```
```console
-> 6
```
Pretty neat, I suppose. This must mean that in our example above, we can in a function into `SinOsc` in place of a value for the `freq` 
argument, and SuperCollider will know how to extract the value! This makes sense, because we can also pass in a `SinOsc` in place of a
static value and use it to create a nice source of dynamicism. We'll see more about this soon, but for now, I think its time to take a 
break!

**Stay *tuned* for more..**


# Notes

<b id="f1">1:</b> I'm assuming the reader has some familiarity with programming languages, whether its JavaScript or Python or Java. 
I'll be using a lot of analogies from other languages, but I'll try to explain things as I go. 
Please comment if you'd like clarification or point out an error, though please realize that this document is intented as a record 
of my *mistakes* as I've been learning the SuperCollider language. [â†©](#a1)

<b id="f2">2:</b> A function literal is a group of
statements surrounded in `{}` (curley brackets). The term *literal* means that you don't need to add a redundent statement declaring
that you intend to create a function, like how most everything is in Java. You're probably most familiar with string literals that 
surround the content in `""` quotes like so: `"I am a string"`. JavaScript has Array literals where you can just write 
``` JavaScript
var x = ["I", "am", "a", "string", "array"]
```
but for functions, you have to use the `function` keyword like so
``` JavaScript
function add (arg1, arg2) {
  return arg1 + arg2;
}
```

Since the ES2015 update, JavaScript *basically* has function literals via arrow functions
``` JavaScript
let add = (arg1, arg2) => arg1 + arg2 
let x = add(1, 2) // evaluates to: x = 1 + 2
```
but it isn't quite the same as in SuperCollider. [â†©](#a2)

---

<b id="f3">3:</b> We don't need to specify the argument names, but I wrote it here to document what the arguments mean. It 
could have looked like so:
``` SuperCollider
y = {SinOsc.ar(220, 0, 0.25, 0)}.play;
// or
y = {SinOsc.ar(220, 0, 0.25)}.play;
// or
y = {SinOsc.ar(freq:220, mul:0.25)}.play;
// etc..
```
