# Greetings
I've been very interested in getting back into writing algorithmic electronic music from scratch. Its what I spent a great deal of time on in undergrad
using software like [MaxMSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/) and [PureData](https://puredata.info/). Heres a piece from my 'senior project' called [Crystal Growth](https://soundcloud.com/nickgideo/crystal-growth).  

When I started with using MaxMSP and PD, I barely knew anything about programming. For instance, Crystal Growth could have easily been 
constructed from a set of loops, but because I didn't understand how to use loops I basically hard-wired everything.
